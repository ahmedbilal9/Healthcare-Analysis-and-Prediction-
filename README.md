# 🏥 Healthcare Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing healthcare data to uncover meaningful insights, identify patterns, and build predictive models for healthcare-related outcomes.  
The notebook walks through **data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning modeling** to demonstrate how data science can improve decision-making in the healthcare sector.

## Model
Several machine learning models were applied to the dataset, including:
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Trees**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **Gradient Boosting / XGBoost**

The models were evaluated on classification metrics such as **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC** to determine their effectiveness in predicting healthcare outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis contains healthcare-related features such as patient demographics, medical conditions, and treatment outcomes.  
Data preprocessing steps included:
- Handling missing values  
- Encoding categorical variables  
- Scaling numerical features  
- Train/test splitting for model validation
